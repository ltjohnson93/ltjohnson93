Would anybody like to implement code into bluetooth devices , the goal of this is to implement a code or series of docks to connect two different kinds of speakers, old, and new.
Bluetooth has always amazed me, and with that being said , I would like to amaze the world with being able to use their old bluetooth devices together (paired with a docking station)
that allows for both sets of bluetooth speakers to be added and also, more ports for more speakers to be added. 
I need someone to make a Docking station for bluetooth devices that allows for :
Hdmi Input
Optical audio input
Bluetooth pairing for multiple speakers to be added and play simotaneously with whatever else is connected to the docking station.
Usb port for charging, also maybe a 120v plug in the back for other pc speakers and the like- to be added as well.
Charging for type-c and lightning for both android and iphone devices.


remember, the more speakers, the better. hopefully this helps bring old speakers that nobody wants to use anymore or strictly use for pc, to be put to use for surround sound
and also helps put more than one bluetooth speaker connection going at one time, almost like a party chain, but more compatible with other speakers via ports and hardware.
